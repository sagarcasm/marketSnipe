negative,1,"Economy Is Still Weak, Fed Finds",,,"The U.S. economy remained ""lackluster"" at the beginning of this month, with factory output and jobs steady or declining, retailers selling little more than they did a year earlier and banks finding little new demand for loans, the Federal Reserve said yesterday.</br></br>About the only bright spots the Fed found in the latest of its periodic nationwide surveys of business and banking conditions were growing orders for U.S. exports, a modest gain in new home building and a rush by homeowners to refinance their mortgages.</br></br>Otherwise, the president and Congress, who are under increasing pressure to take action to boost growth, can expect little help from natural economic forces until midyear, the survey indicated. Executives questioned by the Fed's 12 regional banks said they ""generally anticipate that economic conditions will improve by midyear.""</br></br>The year-end gain in housing found by the survey was mirrored in a Commerce Department report yesterday that showed housing starts rose 2.6 percent last month, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.103 million units. The December figure was 30 percent higher than last January's recession low, which amounted to an annual rate of only 847,000 units.</br></br>For all of 1991, however, housing starts totaled 1.015 million units, down nearly 15 percent from 1990, and the lowest figure since the end of World War II."
negative,0.3333,The Great Terror; A massive new history of Hitler's tyranny.,,,"Looking at the enormous -- and incessant -- tide of books and articles written about Hitler and the Third Reich, we may note an interesting discrepancy. The majority of non-German historians and authors have devoted and are still devoting their main interests to Hitler's war and crimes, to the second six years of the Reich, 1939- 45. The majority of German historians and authors have devoted their main interests to topics and themes about the first six years, 1933- 39. This is understandable. In 1939 Hitler chose war, with the results of total defeat for Germany and Germans. But what led up to that? What happened to the German people before that fatal turning point?</br></br>The Third Reich in Power is Richard J. Evans's attempt to answer many of those questions through historical synthesis. The second part of this British historian's planned three-volume history of Nazi Germany, it is crammed with information (data, statistics, official and private records and reminiscences), sustained by the author's knowledge of German and his acquaintance with all kinds of German sources, many of them relatively recent ones. This heavy volume amounts to something like a massive handbook of a very big subject. It consists of seven large parts, made up of four chapters each, moving from the history of the Nazi police state to that of propaganda, religion, artistic and intellectual life, economy and finance, class structure, Jews and finally ""The Road to War"" -- that is, Hitler's foreign policy.</br></br>Yet there are things wrong with both the content and the writing of this massive book. Its long chapters about economics, finance and nationalization of German industry, detailing their difficulties, miss the essence of Hitler's thinking. ""Why should I nationalize the industry?"" he once said. ""I shall nationalize the people"" -- which is what he did (alas, quite successfully). Compared to that, Evans's citing of the occasional private grumblings of industrialists such as Gustav Krupp are largely devoid of meaning.</br></br>His judgments are sometimes contradictory. On page 370, he writes that ""the economy was clearly in no shape to sustain a prolonged conflict in 1938-1939."" (""Clearly""? And did Hitler plan for ""a prolonged conflict""?) But on page 409, he states that ""the economy had recovered from the Depression faster than its counterparts in other countries. Germany's foreign debt had been stabilized, interest rates had fallen to half their 1932 level, the stock exchange had recovered from the Depression, the gross national product had risen by 81 per cent over the same period. . . . Inflation and unemployment had been conquered."" Another contradiction: ""Everything that happened in the Third Reich took place in this pervasive atmosphere of fear and terror, which never slackened and indeed became far more intense towards the end."" Yet on many other pages, Evans mentions umpteen examples of the regime relenting its pressures for tactical purposes (for example, before and during the 1936 Berlin Olympics).</br></br>This heavy book is chock-full with statistics. Yet there is no mention of such very telling numbers as the increase in German marriages from about 511,000 in 1932 to 611,000 in 1936; the jump from 921,000 births in 1932 to 1,280,000 in 1936, meaning that for every two children born in Germany in 1932, three were born just four years later; the fact that in 1938 and 1939, most marriages in all of Europe were registered in Germany, exceeding the numbers among even the prolific people of Eastern Europe; or the statistic that suicides committed by young people under 20 dropped by 80 percent (!) during the first six years of the Hitler regime -- all symptoms of a great and ominous rise of German national confidence."
negative,0.3337,"So, They Can Say No",,,"For more years than most can remember, the Democratic Party has labored under the handicap of being known as the Ado Annie of American politics. She is the character in Rodgers' and Hammerstein's ""Oklahoma"" who sings of herself: I'm just a girl who can't say no.</br></br>The inability of the Democrats to say no to wonderful-sounding, extravagant schemes is probably the single biggest reason they have lost four of the five presidential races since Lyndon Johnson left the White House. Johnson in his long congressional career and in his five years as president made a high art of public benefaction.</br></br>From the gift of government-subsidized electricity to his Hill Country neighbors at the start of his career, to Medicare and Model Cities in the high-flying Great Society days at the end, he practiced generosity of unparalleled scale with the taxpayers' money. His stump speeches in the 1964 campaign promised that Washington would provide help for ""Molly and the babies,"" down to and specifically including ""a house for the family and pictures on the walls.""</br></br>Appreciative as they were of those benefits, the voters have decided in every presidential election but one since 1968 that enough is enough. Though they regularly tell pollsters they think the Democrats are more sympathetic to working people and their problems and have given those Democrats a near-permanent lease on Congress, they have thought it prudent to keep a check on extravagance by having the GOP control the White House.</br></br>This is a gut-level, instinctive, extraconstitutional addition to the many other ""checks and balances"" in our system of government. It's a psychological comfort to a citizenry that covets the public-financed programs Democrats dangle, but has been burned badly by inflation the past two times the Democrats had the keys to the White House as well as Congress in their hands."
positive,0.3341,Beware The Year of The Surplus,,,"For the past 15 years, one huge, looming menace has dominated American public policy; the federal deficit Fear of the deficit has deterred Democrats from launching big new programs and Republicans from securing big new tax cuts. Now all that has changed.</br></br>The deficit which only five years ago amounted to a record $290 biffion, has suddenly disappeared, and Washington is about to become a very different place— possibly a more dangerous one. The deficit applied constraints that made major policy changes almost impossible. Incrementalism ruled, and that’s been a good thing.</br></br>As the growth of government has slowed, the growth of the private sector has accelerated, and the nation has become more prosperous. In a kind of ironic feedback loop, that prosperity has led to increased tax revenues, which have brought down the deficit and led us to 1998, the Year of the Surplus.</br></br>And so, in this new Washington, for the the first time since the Vietnam War, there’s money to spend. Potentially a lot of _ money. The figures are astonishing but at . this point only dimly comprehended by a • public that’s been bombarded fdr years ; with deficit-fighting rhetoric, much of it phony.	.</br></br>Take a look. In fiscal year 1997, which ended on Sept 30, the budget deficit was just $23 billion.

Stovall, president of Stovall/Twenty-First Advisers Inc.</br></br>Analysts trying to explain the sharp turnaround said Friday's 171-point plunge by the Dow resulted from misplaced panic by bond traders and hedge fund managers when the government reported an unexpected increase in jobs nationwide in February.

negative,0.3577,The Heavy Cost of Continued Inflation,,,"Regardless of any mitigating qualifications that may be read into it, the unemployment of 6 per cent of the national labor force in December is a sobering commentary on the economic transition through which the United States is passing. Undoubtedly it does reflect in part the winding down of the war in Vietnam. In larger measure it is a product of the economic slowdown deliberately brought about to curb an alarming rise in inflation. The specific cause in any particular case will not lessen the distress of jobless families, however, and that distress is now sufficiently widespread to make corrective measures imperative.</br></br>The classical method of dealing with inflation has always had an ironic twist. The curtailment of economic activity to relieve the upward pressure on prices has exacted sacrifices from those least able to bear them. This time, moreover, the irony has multiplied. While 4.6 million unemployed are tightening their belts because of the scarcity of jobs, millions of other workers are taking advantage of the continued inflation to boost their incomes, with little or no regard for what the general consequences may be.</br></br>In addition to this special toll exacted from people who lose their jobs, the economic trends of the last year have been rough on a large majority of wage earners. Hourly pay has advanced over the last year by 5.8 per cent, but the cost of living in November was 5.6 per cent above the figure a year ago. In other words, almost the entire increase was eaten up by higher prices, with no allowance for the rise in worker productivity, which is now increasing again.</br></br>last year. Department of Labor statistics for the first nine months of 1970, the latest available, show “a mean wage and benefit package adjustment of 10 per cent a year.” The average first-year wage and benefit change during that same period amounted to 14.7 per cent a year. Economists recognize these exorbitant wage increases in some key industries as a leading cause of continued inflation even in the face of lax economic activity.</br></br>One segment of labor, the unemployed, is taking a severe drubbing from the current economic situation while another, the large powerful unions, is riding the crest of excessive benefits for its own members. The sacrifice imposed on workers at the bottom of the scale for the sake of attaining a stable economy is proving to be ineffective in part because of the extraordinary power exerted by other labor groups at the top of the scale."
negative,0.629,Global Slide Of Dollar Deepens;Trading Against Mark Weakest Since War,,,"The dollar yesterday continued its steady, but orderly, slide in global markets, closing at the end of trading in Europe at the lowest level against the German mark since the end of World War II.</br></br>Experts said that the dollar's weakness is the direct result of general economic malaise in the United States and higher interest rates in Japan and Europe that are attracting investment there. The trading also reflects widely held expectations that the Federal Reserve Board will soon lower short-term U.S. rates even further to fight an incipient recession.</br></br>""The best thing that could happen now for the United States,"" said foreign exchange expert Geoffrey Bell of the New York company bearing his name, ""is a falling dollar that would work against recession by improving exports and reducing imports.""</br></br>At the close of trading in Europe, the dollar was down to 1.5605 marks, compared with 1.5685 on Tuesday. Trading in New York hit a low of 1.5540 before rebounding slightly to close at 1.5660. Against the yen, the dollar also retreated, closing at 147.65 yen in New York, down from 148.85 the day before.</br></br>Government officials have shown little concern over the dollar's recent weakness, and there were no signs of intervention in the currency market by the United States or any of its economic partners in the so-called Group of Seven industrial nations.

negative,0.3407,The Biggest Boom Ever,,,"We are about to rewrite history. Unless a recession begins in the next few days, this boom will soon become the longest in the American experience. In February, it will have lasted 107 months. The current record is 106 months between February 1961 and December 1969, according to the dating of business cycles by the National Bureau of Economic Research. By and large, Americans are behaving as if recessions are a relic of the past, even though everyone must realize that the boom will end someday--and might end badly.</br></br>As with all records, people will celebrate and assert bragging rights. President Clinton always claims credit and will almost certainly repeat the claims in tomorrow's State of the Union. Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, is idolized for his presumed role. The murkier truth is that the boom's causes remain obscure and, to the extent they can be identified, reflect a protracted and largely nonpolitical process.</br></br>Low inflation has been the critical catalyst. In the past, rising inflation has doomed expansions through higher interest rates, increased labor costs and squeezed profits. Consumer spending, housing construction and business investment all suffered. Yet, inflation now remains tame. By various measures, it's running between 1 percent and slightly more than 2 percent a year. This is lower than in 1990 (between 4 percent and 6 percent by the same measures) and defies the conventional tendency of inflation to worsen as the economy ""heats up."" * The Fed: Paul Volcker, chairman of the Fed between 1979 and 1987, crushed inflationary expectations. In the 1960s and 1970s, these had become ingrained. Companies raised prices because they expected customers would pay. Workers expected pay raises to compensate for higher prices--and then some. The Fed blessed the process by creating more money. Its permissive policies rested on the prevailing--but faulty--theory that a bit of inflation aided economic growth. By 1980 inflation had reached double digits. Volcker tightened money, increased interest rates and caused a savage recession. In 1982 unemployment neared 11 percent. Though brutal, the downturn stifled wage and price increases. By 1983 inflation was 4 percent. President Reagan sanctioned Volcker's policy by muting criticism. Since then, Greenspan's Fed has pursued ""price stability"" and has raised interest rates (as in 1994) to prevent inflation's upward creep. Presidents Bush and Clinton have emulated Reagan's self- restraint.</br></br>* Better Management: Through the 1970s, corporate managers were rarely fired. Their job tenure rivaled university professors'. In the 1980s, things changed. Managers became vulnerable to job loss for many reasons: the recession; foreign competition; deregulation in the airline, trucking and communications industries; ""hostile"" corporate takeovers; the growth of new discounters (Wal-Mart, Home Depot). Self- preservation made managers more ruthless. They cut costs to raise profits. Old plants were shut. Layoffs and ""downsizings"" became common. Again, the immediate consequences were often cruel and (as with Volcker's recession) widely deplored. But the lasting effect was less inflationary behavior.</br></br>* New Technology: As everyone knows, business investment in computers and communications has exploded. The presumption is that these investments enable companies to do things faster and cheaper-- they raise ""productivity."" Firms can minimize unneeded inventories or speed the processing of customer orders. Higher productivity can be magical. If a company improves productivity 3 percent, it can raise wages 3 percent without increasing prices or sacrificing profits. And productivity has improved. In recent years, it's approached 3 percent a year, up from 1.6 percent in the 1980s."

However, the details showed little sign of excessive weakness that would point to a serious slump.</br></br>While employers added 94,000 workers to their payrolls, the total number of hours worked last month fell 0.2 percent as firms cut back slightly on the length of the average workweek. The reduction was sharpest in the manufacturing sector, where payrolls were virtually unchanged but hours worked dropped by 0.7 percent.</br></br>""It looks pretty favorable to me,"" said economist James Glassman of Chase Securities in New York.

If you could freeze everything where it is now, it would be just about perfect.</br></br>""Growth has slowed to a sustainable rate, workers' pay is going up and inflation fears are waning,"" Glassman said.

negative,0.629,The Case for A Recession,,,"Economist Bill Helming runs a small consulting service in Shawnee Mission, Kans. His clients include major food companies, banks, supermarket chains, feed-lot operators and farmers. Of 80 economists surveyed recently by the Blue Chip Economic Indicators-a newsletter that follows economic forecasts-Helming is the gloomiest. He's predicting recession. In 1990, unemployment would average 6.5 percent, up from March's 5 percent. And the economy's output of goods and services (gross national product) would drop 1.5 percent.</br></br>What this country could use is a modest recession to reverse rising inflation. Chances are you won't read that elsewhere. In polite society, almost no one admits that recessions are inevitable and sometimes desirable. What's unmentionable, though, happens to be true. Outside of wartime-when people may tolerate wage and price controls-periodic recessions have been the only practical way of containing inflation. It's a truth worth remembering as the 1980s' economic expansion (now in its seventh year) enters its final stages.</br></br>There are multiplying signs of strains. By every indicator (consumer prices, producer prices and labor costs), inflation is increasing. Since last spring the Federal Reserve has raised short-term interest rates more than 3 percentage points. Although unemployment remains low, some of the zip is going out of the economy. Auto sales are dropping. Home buying is declining and increases in retail sales have been small. But the Fed does not say for a moment that it's trying to engineer a recession, and few private economists dare predict one.</br></br>Analysts like Helming are the exceptions. The typical forecaster anticipates a relatively harmless slowdown. Of the forecasts regularly followed by the ""blue chip"" newsletter, the average calls for economic growth (the increase in GNP) of 2.7 percent in 1989 and 1.7 percent in 1990, compared with 3.9 percent in 1988. This is what the Fed says it wants: in the""What this country could use is a modest recession to reverse rising inflation."" current jargon, a ""soft landing"" that will somehow disarm inflation.</br></br>On paper, the strategy could work. In practice, the odds are against it. The process by which inflation relents is no great mystery. Higher unemployment relieves pressures for steeper wage increases. Excess inventories, idle factory capacity and ample supplies of commodities (such as grains, metals and chemicals) weaken price pressures. If slower growth doesn't produce these conditions, inflation almost certainly won't abate. It could get worse. That's the danger, because both consumer prices and labor costs are already advancing at a rate of about 5 percent annually."

The claim was that failing to raise taxes on high-income earners would place a disproportionate share of the pain on the rest. But it is our record-high government spending, not the failure to raise taxes on the rich, that is the typical American's largest long-term problem.</br></br>Workers do well only when the economy grows at a healthy and consistent pace. The biggest threat to long-term economic growth is government growth of the magnitude that characterized the past two years and that is forecast for our future.</br></br>Our current problems are not a result of acts of nature. They stem from policy choices that dramatically increased the size of the government. In the past two years, the federal budget has grown by a whopping 16%. Importantly, growth in agency budgets other than Defense exceeded that in Defense, despite the surge in Afghanistan. The budget for Health and Human Services, for example, home to Medicare and Medicaid, rose a hefty 22%, as compared with 12% for Defense.</br></br>The sum of 11 other agencies, such as the Departments of Agriculture, Education and Labor, which combined account for more annual spending than Defense, experienced an increase of more than 50% over the two-year period. Some of the budget increases, like those associated with unemployment insurance, should disappear when the economy rebounds, but much of the addition is permanent and is reflected in the president's projected future budget numbers.</br></br>What has the increase bought us? The president would have us believe that but for the stimulus, the economy would have sunk into the next Great Depression. The numbers tell a different story. Estimates of the effect of the stimulus on gross domestic product (GDP) range from zero to three percentage points of GDP.

The market rallied strongly through mid-June, in part on speculation the Fed might use unconventional methods, such as buying longer-dated Treasurys, to ease monetary policy if the need arose.</br></br>But since late June, economists said, Fed officials seem to have tried to respond to what appeared to be a bubble-like appreciation in Treasurys. David Greenlaw, an economist at Morgan Stanley in New York, pointed to a statement by the Fed after a policy meeting in late June. ""We've certainly seen the lows in yield"" of this cycle, Mr. Greenlaw said, adding that the selloff in July has ""recorrected"" the Treasurys market back to where it was before deflation talk took hold."

negative,0.3333,The Great Terror; A massive new history of Hitler's tyranny.,,,"Looking at the enormous -- and incessant -- tide of books and articles written about Hitler and the Third Reich, we may note an interesting discrepancy. The majority of non-German historians and authors have devoted and are still devoting their main interests to Hitler's war and crimes, to the second six years of the Reich, 1939- 45. The majority of German historians and authors have devoted their main interests to topics and themes about the first six years, 1933- 39. This is understandable. In 1939 Hitler chose war, with the results of total defeat for Germany and Germans. But what led up to that? What happened to the German people before that fatal turning point?</br></br>The Third Reich in Power is Richard J. Evans's attempt to answer many of those questions through historical synthesis. The second part of this British historian's planned three-volume history of Nazi Germany, it is crammed with information (data, statistics, official and private records and reminiscences), sustained by the author's knowledge of German and his acquaintance with all kinds of German sources, many of them relatively recent ones. This heavy volume amounts to something like a massive handbook of a very big subject. It consists of seven large parts, made up of four chapters each, moving from the history of the Nazi police state to that of propaganda, religion, artistic and intellectual life, economy and finance, class structure, Jews and finally ""The Road to War"" -- that is, Hitler's foreign policy.</br></br>Yet there are things wrong with both the content and the writing of this massive book. Its long chapters about economics, finance and nationalization of German industry, detailing their difficulties, miss the essence of Hitler's thinking. ""Why should I nationalize the industry?"" he once said. ""I shall nationalize the people"" -- which is what he did (alas, quite successfully). Compared to that, Evans's citing of the occasional private grumblings of industrialists such as Gustav Krupp are largely devoid of meaning.</br></br>His judgments are sometimes contradictory. On page 370, he writes that ""the economy was clearly in no shape to sustain a prolonged conflict in 1938-1939."" (""Clearly""? And did Hitler plan for ""a prolonged conflict""?) But on page 409, he states that ""the economy had recovered from the Depression faster than its counterparts in other countries. Germany's foreign debt had been stabilized, interest rates had fallen to half their 1932 level, the stock exchange had recovered from the Depression, the gross national product had risen by 81 per cent over the same period. . . . Inflation and unemployment had been conquered."" Another contradiction: ""Everything that happened in the Third Reich took place in this pervasive atmosphere of fear and terror, which never slackened and indeed became far more intense towards the end."" Yet on many other pages, Evans mentions umpteen examples of the regime relenting its pressures for tactical purposes (for example, before and during the 1936 Berlin Olympics).</br></br>This heavy book is chock-full with statistics. Yet there is no mention of such very telling numbers as the increase in German marriages from about 511,000 in 1932 to 611,000 in 1936; the jump from 921,000 births in 1932 to 1,280,000 in 1936, meaning that for every two children born in Germany in 1932, three were born just four years later; the fact that in 1938 and 1939, most marriages in all of Europe were registered in Germany, exceeding the numbers among even the prolific people of Eastern Europe; or the statistic that suicides committed by young people under 20 dropped by 80 percent (!) during the first six years of the Hitler regime -- all symptoms of a great and ominous rise of German national confidence."

positive,0.3333,The `Reagan Revolution',,,"The Reagan Revolution isn't and never was. Yet it remains a standard reference point in Washington political analysis and reporting. Its invention and survival illustrate just how mediocre much political journalism is: simplistic, lacking in historical perspective and often wrong. The first job of journalism is to ""get it right"" - to be accurate. All too often, political reporting doesn't. It amounts to mythmaking.</br></br>I take as my text for this grumpy thesis two recent articles in powerful publications. Both try to explain President Clinton's troubles and successes in terms of the alleged Reagan Revolution. Both exemplify persisting sins of political journalism, which is often a triumph of slogans over facts. Politics is viewed, as James Reston often wrote, as sport. The object of reporting is to explain who wins, who loses, why and what it means.</br></br>The trouble is that politics is not just a game - a series of electoral and legislative contests - but also an expression of national habits and values. Unless these are understood, politics can't be adequately reported. Much political commentary ignores this larger context. Consider a front-page ""news analysis"" in the New York Times on Aug. 1. Titled ""Reagan's Curse on Clinton,"" it attributed Clinton's difficulty in passing his budget to ""the Presidency of Ronald Reagan and the political climate he created.""</br></br>Wrote R. W. Apple Jr., the Times' Washington bureau chief: ""Mr. Reagan successfully argued that government itself was the problem. Most federal programs were bad; taxes were bad; spending was bad... . {The result is that} politicians are terrified to wear that awful label, `tax and spend,' however much their constituents need government money for health care or roads.""</br></br>Every trend or change must be credited to or blamed on somebody. What's missed are deeper currents in American thinking and society. Reagan didn't create the mood that Apple describes. Americans have always been suspicious of concentrated power, and national government is - for better or worse - now our most powerful institution. Even in 1958, 43 percent of Americans felt that the federal government ""wasted a lot"" of money."

That's less than a 2.5 percent increase in overall federal taxes. Suppose that ultimately another $25 billion is needed to close the budget deficits. The total still represents less than a 5 percent increase. No one likes to pay higher taxes, but these amounts won't impoverish most Americans or cripple the economy.</br></br>How will we get hit? Higher ""sin"" taxes on cigarettes, beer and liquor seem likely. So are steeper ""user fees"" for, say, airline passengers. The impulse of Democrats and Republicans alike is to construct a package of many small-and highly technical-increases so that no one sees much impact. The budget summit should do better than that.</br></br>It should not just raise taxes but should do so in a way that makes the overall federal tax system fairer and more efficient. How about a ""carbon tax"": a tax on oil, natural gas and coal? This would depress energy use, air pollution and emissions that contribute to the ""greenhouse effect."" How about taxing capital gains (the profits on the sales of stock or other assets) when people die? Closing this loophole, which benefits mainly the wealthy, could raise at least $2 billion to $3 billion a year.</br></br>As they go about this political drudgery, the White House and Congress should adhere to three guidelines:</br></br>First, keep income-tax rates low. A tax system with high rates and many special tax breaks (credits, deductions, income exclusions) invites abuse and waste. Hordes of tax lawyers and accountants are deployed to help people and companies minimize their taxes. Investment decisions are skewed by tax breaks. The 1986 tax-reform act was an attempt to get away from this sort of system by lowering tax rates and eliminating some tax breaks. We shouldn't backtrack on it."

According to Ned Davis Research Inc., Nokomis, Fla., the Dow's biggest correction in 1995 was a record low 3.3%. In addition, Ned Davis Research says the Dow, which hit its last bear market bottom in October 1990, has put in its longest run ever without a 10% correction.</br></br>But the spectacular year required something akin to a razor's edge dance by the economy. The enriching combination of modest growth with good profits -- the so-called soft landing -- came about despite a great deal of cynicism that it could ever happen.</br></br>Can that perfect combination continue?

As economist Larry Kudlow points out, we are now officially in a private-sector recession (two straight quarters of no growth in the economy outside of government). A weak economy in 2002 will mean major and potentially catastrophic GOP losses at the polls in the crucial midterm elections.</br></br>Yet ever since the passage of the president's tax cut back in June, the GOP's legislative momentum has slammed nose first into a concrete wall erected by Tom Daschle and Dick Gephardt. Virtually every bill that now is speeding through Congress is a growth depressant. The legislative docket is filled with financially bearish legislation -- to wit, the patients' bill of rights (which will cause a rash of lawsuits and enrich the trial lawyers); the Medicare prescription drug benefit (which could cost taxpayers $300 billion over the next 10 years); the farm bill (which would give away record subsidies to the agri-business industry); and the appropriations bills (that could allow spending to grow by 8% or 9% this year). President Bush should announce that he will veto any or all of these until the economy recovers.</br></br>This is America's first New Economy recession. American investors, of all incomes, have lost an unprecedented $4 to $5 trillion in wealth in the past 18 months. There's no reassuring market signal that these losses will be recouped anytime soon and there's certainly little federal action to revive growth. These enormous wealth losses have not yet punctured consumer confidence or spending, and they have not caused many net job losses. Nor have real estate values taken a hit. Not yet, at least.</br></br>We are surfing uncharted waters. This recession is driven by a drought in investment, not a conventional drought in consumption. High risk capital investment funding -- one of the driving forces behind the powerful expansion of the mid- and late-1990s -- has dried up. Venture capital funding is down more than 50% so far this year and the IPO market is moribund.</br></br>Over the past several weeks, the White House proclamations on the economy by Larry Lindsey and Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill have been mostly happy talk about recovery by the end of the year. Let's hope they're right. But what if they're not? Where is the economic and political contingency plan? A pep talk is not enough to rescue the economy from its doldrums.

But the folks who trade the government's debt are losing their shirts.</br></br>Although $100 billion of Treasury securities are bought and sold daily on Wall Street, making the Treasury bond market by far the single biggest securities market in the world, most bond traders can't make any money.</br></br>The problem: Too many bond dealers chasing too few customers have squeezed profit margins to the bare bones. Ten years ago, a dealer typically could expect to make a $1,250 profit on a $1 million trade of Treasury notes, said Richard M. Kelly, president of bond dealer Aubrey G. Lanston & Co. Now, that profit has shrunk to just $312.50, he said.</br></br>Nowhere is the suffering worse than at the nation's primary dealers, an elite group of big commercial banks and brokerage firms that buy and sell government bonds directly with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York as it executes monetary policy.

negative,1,The Economy: April's Employment Data Show Third Straight Month of Job Cuts,,,"Companies continued to shed workers in April, and the latest data gave little indication that a significant job-market rebound is imminent.</br></br>In its latest monthly employment report, the Labor Department said U.S. nonagricultural companies eliminated 48,000 payroll jobs last month, following a combined decline of 477,000 jobs in February and March. Although the decline wasn't as steep as some had expected, other statistics in the report clearly suggested that the labor market is weaker than many economists anticipated.</br></br>For example, job losses in the manufacturing sector were enormous; jobs fell 95,000 in April. The unemployment rate, meanwhile, rose to 6% from 5.8%. Most troublesome, the average workweek fell 0.3 hour, an indication that companies don't have enough work to occupy even those employees that remain after the latest cuts. Many economists say hiring will pick up only after there is an uptick in hours worked, since companies generally try to make their existing employees work longer before they hire additional people.</br></br>In Washington, President Bush used the jump in the unemployment rate to spur members of Congress to pass a ""robust"" tax-cut package to stimulate the economy. Speaking to defense workers in California, the president took the issue of the rising jobless rate, a potential political liability, and turned it to his advantage. The rising unemployment rate, he said, ""should serve as a clear signal to the United States Congress we need a bold economic recovery package so people can find work.""</br></br>Since the jobs report shows no sign of the postwar pickup that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has been predicting, it will probably make some already-pessimistic Fed officials even more convinced an immediate cut in interest rates is needed. However, Mr. Greenspan told Congress last week that only ""limited"" information is available on the economy's performance since war uncertainty began to lift, though he already knew the job market had weakened further in April. That suggests he will counsel patience at tomorrow's central-banking meeting, rather than advocate cutting short-term rates from their current, 42-year low of 1.25%."

But these are not normal times, and anyone who is not afraid after a 50% market decline has a few screws loose. The trick is to channel your fear into sensible action that will improve your financial future.</br></br>Instead of big impulsive steps you may regret later, you should take small and careful steps that will make you feel you have taken charge. Mental-health experts have found that merely believing you have some control over a painful situation is enough to make the pain more bearable. At a time like this, taking a little bit of action can give you a lot of comfort -- both as an immediate salve for your market wounds today and as a portfolio strengthener in the years to come.</br></br>For investors, that means being deliberate in everything you do and making sure that all your decisions are gradual and incremental, rather than sudden and drastic. Call it ""smart panic"" -- calculated actions that free you from the chains of inertia without compelling you to go haywire.</br></br>Normally, inertia keeps investors locked into all their investments, good and bad. As Sir Isaac Newton might have put it, an investor at rest stays at rest, and an investor in motion stays in motion, unless acted upon by an outside force.

The stock market sidestepped into the new year and promptly fell about 250 points as of Friday's close. Markets reacted coldly last Tuesday to a 40-year bond offering by the government's S&L bailout agency. Gold began the year at about $400 and in three weeks is up to $420. Simultaneously, the White House has turned a bit cranky over the Fed's handling of monetary policy.</br></br>Most economists still expect merely a slowdown in growth, but the sense that something's wrong is palpable. What we've witnessed is entirely consistent with what we predicted in our two ""Mitchell Recession"" editorials in November. The market, and through it the general economy, is being whipsawed by Congress's handling of the capital-gains issue. We first noted back on November 7 that Senator Mitchell was congratulating himself for killing the Bush capital-gains proposal, and wondered whether he'd take credit later if the economy stalled. On November 30, with the market at 2688 we wrote:</br></br>""The stock market, after rising while a capital-gains cut gained political momentum, collapsed 190 points when Mr. Mitchell stopped it, and now remains at about the August 1 level. Everyone is therefore looking for the Fed to ease monetary policy.""</br></br>The market rallied a bit in December; tax advisers suggested that normal year-end profit-taking be pushed into 1990, because their consensus among people who mattered -- George Bush, Lloyd Bentsen, Dan Rostenkowski was that a capital-gains cut in 1990 was baked in the cake."

negative,0.6525,Home Prices Are Still Too High; They would have to decline another 20% just to get back to the historical trend line.,,,"Author: Peter D. Schiff</br></br>Most economists concede that a lasting general recovery is unlikely without a recovery in the housing market. A marked increase in defaults and foreclosures from today's already elevated levels could produce losses that overwhelm banks and trigger another, deeper financial crisis. Study after study has shown that defaults go up when falling prices put mortgage holders ""underwater."" As a result, the trajectory of home prices has tremendous economic significance.</br></br>Earlier this year market observers breathed easier when national prices stabilized. But the ""robo-signing""-induced slowdown in the foreclosure market, the recent upward spike in home mortgage rates, and third quarter 2010 declines in the Standard & Poor's Case-Shiller home-price index--including very bad October numbers reported this week--have sparked concerns that a ""double dip"" in home prices is probable. A longer-term view of home price trends should sharply magnify this fear.</br></br>Even those economists worried about renewed price dips would be unlikely to believe that the vicious contractions of 2007 and 2008 (where prices fell about 30% nationally in just two years) could return. But they underestimate how distorted the market had become and how little it has since normalized.</br></br>By all accounts, the home price boom that began in January 1998, when the previous 1989 peak was finally surpassed, and topped out in June 2006 was extraordinary. The 173% gain in the Case-Shiller 10-City Index (the only monthly data metric that predates the year 2000) in those nine years averaged an eye-popping 19.2% per year. As we know now, those gains had very little to do with market fundamentals, and everything to do with distortionary government policies that set off a national mania for real-estate wealth and a torrent of temporarily easy credit."

In the lead-up to his appearance, there had been growing speculation that the Fed chairman might signal the central bank's willingness to cease paying interest on the reserves it holds on banks' behalf, a move that would be an incentive for banks to lend that money to customers. Indeed, Mr. Bernanke mentioned that idea, along with other prospects for added stimulus in the question-and-answer session, although he said that for now the Fed was still intent on gauging the strength of the recovery."

She's particularly encouraged by a rebound in earnings among smaller concerns in basic industries such as manufacturing, trucking, mining, chemicals and paper. After two years of anemic earnings, third-quarter profits in that group rose 1.5% from a year earlier and are ahead of expectations, she said. Smaller makers of auto parts, household furniture and other economically sensitive goods also exceeded hopes with a 4.2% rise in third-quarter profits, she added.</br></br>Makers of consumer staples and healthcare related companies continued to march ahead, with profits up 45.1% and 42.8%, respectively -- but some health-care earnings came in below expectations, she warned.

negative,0.3694,There Is No 'Structural' Unemployment Problem; A look at the skills-jobs mismatch finds no evidence that changes in the economy explain high joblessness. The problem is slow growth.,,,"The unemployment rate has exceeded 8% for more than three years. This has lead some commentators and policy makers to speculate that there has been a fundamental change in the labor market. The view is that today's economy cannot support unemployment rates below 5%--like the levels that prevailed before the recession and in the late 1990s. Those in government may take some comfort in this view. It lowers expectations and provides a rationale for the dismal labor market.</br></br>Excuses aside, this issue is also important for central banks. The Federal Reserve and other central banks have some policy choices to make if the high rates of unemployment reflect cyclic phenomena. But if the problem is structural--perhaps reflecting a mismatch between skills needed by business and skills possessed by the unemployed--there is little the Fed can do.</br></br>Research I've done with James Spletzer of the U.S. Census Bureau shows that the problems in the labor market are not structural. They reflect slow economic growth, and the cure is a decent recovery.</br></br>In 2007, the unemployment rate was 4.4%. Two years later, it reached 10%. The structure of a modern economy does not change that quickly. The demographic composition of the labor force, its educational breakdown and even the industrial mix did not differ much between 2007 and 2009.</br></br>More specifically, from 2007 to 2009 unemployment grew dramatically in a few industries, and these changes contributed to the rise in overall unemployment. But the changes were similar to those experienced in prior recessions. As unemployment rates declined somewhat after 2009, the pattern played out in reverse. Industries that saw the largest increases in unemployment were the ones with the largest decreases as overall unemployment fell."

Then, the stock market's plunge was much more severe in percentage terms than any of the dips in the past few days. Still, outside of the financial sector, the economy didn't feel any ripple effects until around mid-1989, notes Donald Fine, chief market analyst for Chase Asset Management.</br></br>The 1987 market plunge was steeper than any of the market slides that have coincided with recessions in the past few decades. And many economists believe that, to hurt the economy, today's market would have to suffer consistent and considerably worse drops than it has shown recently. Even then, Mr. Fine says, ""only at some future point"" would it damage consumer spending and other economic sectors.</br></br>In the high-technology sector, where the recent drop has been severe, tumbling stock prices are a reflection of worsening industry performance, said Kenneth R. French, professor of finance at the Yale School of Management. Still, a continued stock price plunge in that sector, he said, might reduce its access to venture capital and inhibit initial public offerings.</br></br>In general, however, the wider economy is largely insulated from the stock market's volatility. True, more ""little guys"" have their money in the stock market today. According Federal Reserve numbers cited by James Poterba, professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 38.4% of all U.S.households held some kind of stock in 1992, the latest year for which data are available, up from 33.2% in 1983.

""Federal expenditures are running well below budgeted levels and the deficit for the current fiscal year won't be as bad as had been feared."" He notes that with the Dow Jones Industrial Average off nearly 15% from its record high last November, it is now at book value.</br></br>In addition, Mr. Carver says that ""less stock is available because over $40 billion in takeovers and stock repurchase programs has shrunk the supply."""
positive,0.3772,Why Dollar May Be Set for a Rebound,,,"Beating down the dollar has become a popular sport lately. But the greenback may be about to get off the mat.</br></br>The dollar's decline this year has been unrelenting. It has fallen 5% against the pound, 7% against the yen, 10% against the euro and 14% against the Canadian dollar. Against the Federal Reserve's trade- weighted basket of currencies, the dollar has dropped 8%.</br></br>For years, most economists have viewed the dollar as an accident waiting to happen. To finance its huge trade deficit, the U.S. has been borrowing heavily from the rest of the world. The thinking was that overseas savers eventually would tire of holding ever-greater quantities of dollar-based assets. When they'd had enough, the dollar would fall.</br></br>And so it has. Many economists think the dollar will weaken further. Maurice Obstfeld of the University of California at Berkeley and Kenneth Rogoff of Harvard University calculated in 2005 that with the broadest measure of the U.S. trade deficit -- the current account -- running at more than 6% of the nation's economic output, the dollar needed to fall as much as 30% against the Fed's currency basket to bring the trade deficit back into balance. (A weaker dollar makes U.S. exports cheaper to foreigners and makes imports costlier for Americans, shrinking the trade gap, as has been happening lately.)</br></br>By that reckoning, the dollar needs to drop an additional 20%. And the Fed's new openness to cutting interest rates, if the textbooks are right, should further weaken the currency as global investors flock to places with higher returns."

First-quarter revisions--down to 0.4% from 1.9%--reflected an economy at a near-standstill early in the year.</br></br>That minimal growth, coming after a recession that new data show was deeper than previously thought, raises doubts about the economy's trajectory for the rest of the year and helps explain the unusually feeble pace of job growth for a recovery entering its third year. Economists generally say a pace of 3% or higher is needed to create jobs.</br></br>""This puts a double dip back on the table,"" said Justin Wolfers, an economist at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School.</br></br>Markets fell on the news, although stocks recovered much of their early losses after President Barack Obama stepped up pressure on Congress to compromise on raising the nation's debt ceiling.

Although they recognize that tax increases hurt the economy, they argue that our huge deficit requires Congress to raise revenue through a tax hike.</br></br>This argument rests on the flawed premise that we can reduce the deficit only by increasing taxes, as if high levels of spending are a given. Not so.</br></br>To reduce spending and reignite growth, this Congress or its successor should take two actions. First, immediately cut the level of spending that has been increased so dramatically since 2008. Second, institute an ""inflation-minus-one"" rule to constrain future spending increases.</br></br>Much public discussion focuses on the deficit, which is indeed at critical levels of around 10% of GDP. But even if President Obama succeeds at lowering the deficit to 4% of GDP by 2013, our public-debt-to-GDP ratio will still be dangerously high, at over 70%, or nearly twice what it was during the Bush years. As the economists Carmen Reinhart and Kenneth Rogoff have shown in the journal American Economic Review, such high debt-to-GDP ratios are associated with low growth."
negative,0.6691,Manager's journal: America's corporations should swear off pork,,,"Earlier this month an ad appeared in this newspaper entitled ""Declaration of Independence: End Corporate Welfare."" It was signed by 61 top Silicon Valley executives, including me. In calling for government to end corporate pork-barrel politics, we were taking a moral stand.</br></br>The first Americans hated taxes; the Constitution limited government and, originally, banned levies on personal income. For the first two centuries of our nation, the common man became better off more quickly than any other time in history. Per capita U.S. gross domestic product grew to $28,540 in 1996 from just $919 (in 1996 dollars) in 1776. Mankind took 30,000 years to get to $919, but only 220 more years to reach $28,540.

With corporate taxes high, companies lobby for give-backs to remain competitive. Congress faces extreme pressure to ""bring home the pork"" to home-state corporations. That requires even higher taxes -- and the circle continues.</br></br>Corporate subsidies are often known by euphemisms such as ""government investments"" or ""government-industry partnerships."" Such Washington-speak notwithstanding, Americans are compelled to pay for silly programs like the proposal by the Commerce Department's Advanced Technology Program to genetically re-engineer cotton, making its fibers more like polyester. Technology subsidies to corporations are sold using technobabble to camouflage unjustifiable investments, which typically fall into four categories:"
